## 2. WHAT WE BUILD

**Section headline:** AI that works in your world.

**Section intro:** We don't sell you a product — we build capabilities tailored to your business.

### Get instant answers.
Your team asks questions in plain language — about sales, operations, donors, inventory, anything — and gets instant, trustworthy answers from your own data. With citations and audit trails.

*"What's trending this quarter?" · "Which location is off plan?" · "Show me all overdue follow-ups."*

### Automate the grind.
The reports, summaries, and follow-ups your team builds every week — generated automatically, in your format, on your schedule.

*Monthly reconciliation · Executive summaries · Re-engagement campaigns · Compliance reports*

### Let AI do the work.
AI that takes a goal, executes the steps, and hands off to humans at the right moments. Not a chatbot — a system that moves work forward.

*Data analysis · Approval routing · Exception handling · Triage and escalation*

## 3. HOW WE WORK

**Section headline:** Three steps. Zero guesswork.

### Step 1 — AI Impact Audit + Demo
We study your workflows, connect to your data, and build a working demo your team can try. You see AI working on your actual information — not a slide deck. You get a clear scope: where AI helps, what impact to expect, and exactly what we'd build.

**Normally $3,000 — FREE for a limited time.**

### Step 2 — Build & Deploy
We build your AI, integrate with your existing systems, validate rigorously, and deploy to production. Fixed scope from the audit. Typical timeline: 4–6 weeks.

### Step 3 — Monitor & Evolve
Once live, we don't disappear. Monitoring, maintenance, updates, and continuous improvement. Your AI gets better over time, not worse.

## 5. WHY PETALUMA AI

**Section headline:** Why Petaluma AI

### Outcomes over promises.
A working demo on your real data before you commit. No experiments on your dime.

### Reliability is the product.
AI that works once is a demo. AI that works every time is what we ship.

### You work with the founders.
No junior analysts. No hand-offs. You work directly with the people who designed the system.

### We're practitioners, not advisors.
We use AI to run our own operations. That's the difference between advice and experience.
